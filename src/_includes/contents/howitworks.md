**How is this working** you ask? We are using **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** to generate this site. We get the artist assets from a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/22n4VI1DJuCp3Hh1Jzn9B6), store them in a JSON file and place the info in web components. Do you want to know more? Check the source code on GitHub or get in touch with us: hello@badwebsites.rip
